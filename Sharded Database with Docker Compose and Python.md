**Sharded Database with Docker Compose and Python**

This Docker Compose app demonstrates how to set up a sharded database with two database shards using MySQL and a Python script to connect, query, and demonstrate the merged database.

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

-   Docker
-   Docker Compose

**Getting Started**

To get started with this app, follow these steps:

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:

    bash

· git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sharded-database.git

· Navigate to the cloned repository:

bash

· cd sharded-database

· Build and run the Docker Compose app:

· docker-compose up

· Once the app is running, you can access the merged database by running the following command:

python

1.  docker exec -it sharded-database_python_1 python merge.py
2.  This will execute the merge.py Python script, which connects to both database shards, queries the data, and merges the results.

**Configuration**

This Docker Compose app is pre-configured with two database shards, each running MySQL. The docker-compose.yml file defines the services for the app, including the database shards and the Python container.

By default, the app uses the following configuration:

-   MySQL shard 1:
    -   Host: localhost
    -   Port: 3306
    -   User: root
    -   Password: password
    -   Database: shard1
-   MySQL shard 2:
    -   Host: localhost
    -   Port: 3307
    -   User: root
    -   Password: password
    -   Database: shard2

You can modify these settings by editing the docker-compose.yml file or by passing environment variables to the containers.

**Customizing the Python Script**

The merge.py Python script connects to the two database shards and queries the data, then merges the results. You can customize this script to perform different queries or to merge the data in a different way.

**Conclusion**

This should help you get started with setting up a sharded database with Docker Compose utilizing a python script. Use this as a starting point for your own sharded database projects.
